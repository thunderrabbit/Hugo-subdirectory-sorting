This repo has some entries I want to sort in Title order

    content/quests/slow-down   ＜ーー  sort by title
    content/blog      ＜ーー  sort by date
    content/journal   ＜ーー  sort by date

The lists all seem to use this template

    themes/purehugo/layouts/_default/list.html

I have tried a variety of locations that make sense to me,
but none override the list.html above
