(started 11:31 Monday 02 August 2021 JST)

1. I finished AniKiko's 1111 course and trusted myself when I heard
her say she keeps saying the same message, "how many different ways can
I say it?"
2. I am on day 2 of 21 in
[SHS](https://www.robnugen.com/journal/2021/07/30/side-hustle-school-order-888/)
3. Breakthrough with Lin last night after I came home later than
expected.  She noticed the projections coming from inside her.
4. I plan to remove the journal repo from my main Barefoot Rob website
so I can compile it separately.
5. Today I created two Milestones for that:  "Split journal
compilation from Barefoot Rob website compilation" and "Bring back
calendar-driven journal entries"
6. I will talk to Emico today about teaching some chakra stuff
7. I ordered Barefoot Rob point cards, but they were printed at
postcard size.  I handed them out last night at dinner in Omotesando
8. Greatly enjoyed Rin and Hiro's [Ecstatic Dance
event](https://tokyoecstaticdancejiaiii.peatix.com/) last night.
9. I plan to ask Hiro-san if she would be willing to help me promote
barefoot walking events in Japanese.
10. Carl has joined DYD for the second month in a row.  Two people in
the program now, including Shraddhan (who leads in case I cannot)
11. Jennie is doing well, and featuring a few more white hairs this
year than before.
12. Alex-progeny (kalanchoe tomentosa) are doing well; there are three
little square pots, with dozens of leaves each
13. Just 3 more teaching days at JB School on Wednesdays: Aug 4th,
18th, 25th
14. Still teaching at SCC twice a month, now using a book for Yuki
15. Yasu left SCC and I have not heard from him, so I just sent him a
message.
16. Lin and I have been doing intermittent fasting of 14+ hours
fasting each day.  Several people at the event yesterday commented
that I have lost weight.  82.7kg just now.
17. I've been semi-targeting 3700 ml of water consumption per day
18. I have a month worth of upcoming Weekly Alignments posted on my
/events page
19. I still need to reduce the size of images served by
b.robnugen.com.  The images are stored at up to like 3 or 4MB but only
need to be served at 1/10th that size.
20. I have been working 20 hours per month with AB
21. Starting with hours billed in June, I have been billing directly
to AB, not via Nate.
22. I am up to date on Rick and Morty, having seen 6 episodes.
Episode 7 is released today-ish but current plan is to wait (until October!) to
watch them with Fred.
23. I have been talking to Ma almost weekly.  She's going to help me
talk to my retirement account manager who cannot talk to me because I
live in Japan.  (legal reasons, not technical)
24. I have not talked to Dad in a bit, but I texted him on Signal
recently.  He has not replied.
25. I have been checking in with Missy semi-regularly.  Hearing left
hand stories gives me a unique perspective on life.
26. Today I told Shraddhan I plan to do an SoML, and that I sometimes
get to 26 notes.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to do it today.
27. Anne and I have finished working together (accountability-wise).  It was an abrupt
change, but I understand her reasoning.
28. Mark and I have started working together (accountability-wise).
Let's see how well we do!
29. âœ“ I can now hit Ctrl-enter in Emacs to add a check mark to the
beginning of a line.
