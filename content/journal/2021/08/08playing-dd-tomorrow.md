Tomorrow we are playing D&D online.  It will be my first official
game, and by official, I mean with a person who has played before
acting as DM.

He has asked us to create characters and I was going to use Thunder
Rabbit (of course) but he asked the we be halflings, gnomes, and
dwarves--of the Wooded Hills.
