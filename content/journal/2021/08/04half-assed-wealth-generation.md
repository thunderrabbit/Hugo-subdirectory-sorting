Due to the international power grab of dang near everything, JB School will close its main location at the end of August.  I'm currently headed to JB for the 3rd to last time.

I'm semi-considering looking for a real job because I hella haven't sorted out my own business income, and it's been years.

At the same time, I think I'm edging ever closer to cracking it by weekly meetings with Eli, thrice weekly meetings with Mark, going through Callan Rush wealth through workshops material, doing half of Ani's 1111 course, halfway doing homework for chakra clearing, and have done some candle magic on occasion.

Buncha halfs up there..  do they add up or multiply?
