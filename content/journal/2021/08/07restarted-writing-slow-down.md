Today I got some inspiration and realized how I can ease the writing
process of [Slow Down](/quests/slow-down/): sort the entries by title
instead of by date.

Dates are tied more toward when something was written or when the
event happened, but the book should be organized by neither nor both
of those things, but by content and presentation to the reader.
