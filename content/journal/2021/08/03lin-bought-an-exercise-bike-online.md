Lin bought an exercise bike online.  It wasn't a good fit for her; its
hardest mode was super easy; its wheel made a scuffing sound inside
its compartment.

Fortunately(?), she was able to return it.  I have heard that the
particular online seller does not process returns so much as throw
them away.  True?  Probably, because it would be hella lot easier to
toss something apparently defective than determine its useability +
refurbish it + resell it.
