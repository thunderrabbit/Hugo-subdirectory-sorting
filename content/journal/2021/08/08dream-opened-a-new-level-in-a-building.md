<p class="dream">
Descending in a building from the roof, where I got permission to
enter the building.  Last time I had been refused because I didn't
have a new card matching my other updated card.
</p>

<p class="dream">
After descending into the building, I finally arrived at the first
floor.  There were two people there and I felt shy to ask then for
directions, but I asked anyway.
</p>

<p class="dream">
"Where is this office?" I asked, while showing them a photo.  The guy
said It was on the other corner of the building and I could go either
way.  I asked which way was closest to their front desk and he said
around toward the left.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I walked the way he said (clockwise around the building), and it
seemed to be a longer way, but I was able to continue, simply by
walking under an angled rope at the next corner of the building.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Beyond the rope, I saw a man silhouette/shadow facing the interior of
the building, but he didn't seem to mind my presence.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I walked past him and saw he was wearing intricate wire earrings.  He
continued to focus on his work, disinterested in me.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I noticed I was walking on astroturf.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Just as I was about to arrive at the destination, I received a call
from good friend Shraddhan, "hey Rob if you were doing your job," he
joked, "you'd know I've been inviting people to your event!"
</p>

<p class="dream">
"Thank you, sorry.  Actually not sorry; I've been doing my job! Gotta
go. I'll call you later."
</p>

<p class="dream">
As I walked, the astroturf surface narrowed toward the corner of the
building until I arrived at the desk where a single tired woman was
apparently working late.
</p>

<p class="dream">
"Hello, my name is Rob Nugen and I'm trying not to fall off the edge
here" my inner voice was then saying "don't say that; you'll just
confuse things"
</p>

<p class="dream">
I continued speaking to her "I was able to get permission to enter the
building this time, so I wonder if you'd be so kind as to schedule
another interview for me with Anon"
</p>

<p class="dream">
She got untired as I spoke with her, and finished my sentence "with
Anon" for me.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Two more people showed up from inside their office.
</p>

<p class="dream">
One was a man offering me a gift of chocolate from their free snack
bar "hey I don't really like these; (you can have them)" as he handed
me an entire bag of intricate chocolates.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I took one chocolate out of the bag, "really? All for me? Thank you."  
</p>

<p class="dream">
The other was a woman offering to go get some tea.  She lifted up a
bag from their snack bar and it spilled huge crumbs on the floor.
None of them seemed worried.  The silhouette man would clean it up.
</p>

<p class="dream">
The man who offered me chocolate got up and stepped beyond where I
could see, past where I had thought I was standing on the narrow edge
of wood around her desk.  Where I had previously beef trying not to
fall off, I discovered there was no cliff; I was now safe. "Oh! I just
realized the floor continues here. sorry about my strange comment
earlier."
</p>

(I woke up near the beginning of Prithivi and wrote this dream.)
