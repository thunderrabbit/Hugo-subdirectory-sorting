Dang

Original plan:

* Leave at 6:15
* Arrive by 7:30 for meeting
* Have 7:30 meeting
* Walk into Dr office at 8

Later in the day I forgot about my 7:30 meeting and rescheduled myself to leave at 6:45.

Then while reading Reddit I missed my 7:15 transfer.

7:25am now, headed back to Noborito.

#### 7:30

So I can sit down, I'm skipping the crowded 7:31 train in favor of the (same speed) train leaving at 7:33.

I'll probably arrive at Dr appointment by 8:05 and am happy with that as the 8:00 arrival is for an 8:30 start.

#### next day

I arrived about 8:08 and everything was just fine.  

At the end I got to do the barium sulfate carnival ride as they checked all parts of my stomach while I tried not to burp.
