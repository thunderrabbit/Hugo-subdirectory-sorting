On Friday I went to meet Missy in 中目黒駅 where we hung out for a bit at the bank and then went to Johnny's art show in Omotesando.

I got to meet Dali, Steve, and Miki (again?)

Also saw TJ and talk to him for a while.

Miki showed me some of her art exhibitions and I ended up buying a print she had done on an aluminum plate, which in itself was really cool. And cold.

Erik came by so it was good to see him since he has been out of town for a long time.

After the art show I walked from there to Yoyogi Koen Station, noticing how the crowds people wearing masks had given way to small groups of people not wearing masks.

That was interesting.
